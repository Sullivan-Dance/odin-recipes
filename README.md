# odin-recipes
This project involved the creation a simplistic recipe website. It consisted of the index
page containing links to the recipes. The recipe pages had similar formats consisting of
the recipe name, its image, the ingredients and the steps. 

This project required usage of various html elements including ordered and unordered lists, 
paragraphs, headings, images and hypertext references.
